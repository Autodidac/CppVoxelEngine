# CppVoxelEngine
A Voxel Engine Library in C++20 for WickedEngine

---


I gotta be honest I'm just getting started with CMake and I doubt this is working, but someday.



Building the Projects

---

Build the Static Library
---
Navigate to the VoxelEngineLib directory and create a build directory:

<code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
</code>


Build the Example Application
---
Navigate to the VoxelEngineApp directory and create a build directory:

<code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
</code>
